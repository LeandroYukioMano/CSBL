Install python-weka-wrapper3

First, you need to be able to compile Python modules:
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev

Now, you can install the various packages that we require for installing python-weka-wrapper:
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-numpy

The following packages are optional, but necessary if you also want some graphical output:
$ sudo apt-get install python-pil python-matplotlib python-pygraphviz

Install OpenJDK as well, in order to get all the header files that javabridge compiles against (but donâ€™t use it for starting up JVMs):
$ sudo apt-get install default-jdk

Finally, you can use pip to install the Python packages that are not available in the repositories:
$ sudo pip install javabridge
$ sudo pip install python-weka-wrapper
